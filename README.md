## Description

Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts is a fictitious arts and crafts website. The purpose of this project is to build static webpage using foundational HTML and CSS for the "Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts" company according to a spec file. 

Only static elements were used in this webpage to serve as a starting point in my web development learning and to build an HTML and CSS file from scratch to incorporate only what is necessary as per the spec file. 

Due to the website's basic nature, many features can be added in the future, especially if customers were to view and purchase items I would include the following:
- Log in page (Authentication)
- Carousel for popular items
- Catalog of items for sale
- Shopping cart
- Email customer their receipt

## Install and Run

To install the project, clone the git repository and drag the file into your selected web browser. Otherwise, open a web browser and enter the file path of the `index.html` file.
